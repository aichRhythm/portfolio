Experience
Associate Consultant | Capgemini India October 2022 – Present
Pune, India
Mobile Banking Application/Developer Tools and Libraries | React Native, Jest, Github Actions
• Designed and developed high-performance, reusable UI components (e.g., datepicker, dropdown,
typeahead, collapsible menus) from scratch using TypeScript and React Native, for a major banking
client, with a focus on pixel-perfect custom designs and animations. Delivered a seamless and polished user
experience across both Android and iOS platforms.
• Leveraged React Native bridging technology to implement backend utility modules, including logger, push
notifications, QR code scanner, and document/media viewer. Integrated native iOS and Android
functionalities into the React Native ecosystem, ensuring cross-platform consistency and leveraging
platform-specific capabilities to enhance performance and functionality.
• Implemented automated testing using Jest and React Testing Library, achieving 95% test coverage for
both unit and integration tests, significantly reducing bugs and regressions.
• Utilized Firebase and Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) for push notifications and real-time
updates, enabling timely communication with users and enhancing the customer experience by providing
instant updates related to account activities and transaction statuses.
• Optimized app performance by implementing code splitting, lazy loading, and memoization techniques,
significantly reducing load times and improving memory efficiency. Used React Profiler and Chrome
DevTools to measure and analyze performance bottlenecks, achieving a 30% reduction in load time and a
20% improvement in memory usage. Enhanced rendering performance for data-intensive features like
media viewing and QR scanning, ensuring a seamless user experience across low-end and high-end devices.
Metrics were tracked using Google Analytics and in-app performance monitoring tools, resulting in a
25% increase in user engagement on resource-constrained devices.
• Implemented CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, automating the process of building, testing, and
deploying the app to Google Play and Apple App Store, which streamlined release cycles and reduced manual
intervention.
Real-time Banking Analytics Dashboard | React, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, Redis
• Developed a real-time banking analytics dashboard for a major banking client using React and a
microfrontend architecture, enabling independent development, testing, and deployment of modular UI
components for features like user transaction details, account statistics, and customer feedback. Built on top of
a pre-existing Node.js backend system to deliver seamless integration.
• Centralized application state management using Redux Toolkit, enabling predictable state transitions across
microfrontends and improving maintainability. Integrated Thunk middleware for handling asynchronous
operations and used Redux DevTools to streamline debugging and enhance developer productivity.
• Collaborated in an Agile development environment with bi-weekly sprints and daily standups, coordinating
with cross-functional teams to prioritize features and rapidly deliver incremental improvements based on client
feedback.
• Optimized PostgreSQL database queries for large-scale transactional data across 100+ bank branches,
reducing query execution time through indexing strategies and query refactoring. Implemented database
partitioning and leveraged Redis for caching query results, improving data retrieval performance for real-time
insights.
• Ensured consistent UI styling across microfrontends using Material UI, while allowing each module to
maintain visual independence. Improved development efficiency by creating a shared component library for
reusable UI elements.
Internship Trainee | Capgemini India February 2022 – April 2022
Pune, India
API layer of Customer Service Application | Express, Node.js, MongoDB, Stripe, SendGrid
• Built and maintained RESTful APIs using Express for the customer service application of an insurance
giant, enabling seamless interactions between customers and backend systems.
• Integrated third-party APIs such as Stripe for payment processing and SendGrid for email communication,
streamlining the customer service experience.
• Utilized MongoDB for database operations, ensuring efficient handling of dynamic, schema-less data
structures related to customer profiles, transaction history, and support tickets.
Production Intern | Nestl´e India April 2021 – May 2021
Goa, India
Automation of product packaging line | Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Powerpoint
• Designed and evaluated automation solutions to streamline sauce packaging, conducting feasibility studies and
vendor assessments. Selected a solution projected to increase throughput by 20% and reduce labor costs.
• Developed a quantitative cost model by integrating data from multiple sources, estimating project costs at
$200,000+ for equipment, software, and materials. Identified cost-saving strategies projected to save 10% over 2
years, validated through vendor quotes and historical cost analysis.
• Optimized labor efficiency by analyzing staffing requirements and collaborating with operations teams.
Implemented a new staffing model that reduced labor needs by 12%, measured through productivity
tracking and overtime reduction reports.
